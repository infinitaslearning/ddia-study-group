# 🙌 Thank You
Let’s dive into discussion.  
- What storage engine patterns are we using in ILPT?
- Do we have visibility into our storage engine behavior?
- What does “storage and retrieval” mean for *our* daily work?
- Any real life experiences with missing indexes / indexes optimisation?
- Any experiences with the data warehouse at ILPT and parallels to what's in the book?
- What do we do to ensure we have good indexes at ILPT?
- Any projects/experiences with databases other than mongo/postgres/sql server?
